# Todoey âœ“

## Our Goal

This is a "fork" of [todoey](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/todoey-flutter) a companion project to The App Brewery's Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp, check out the full course at www.appbrewery.co

## What it does

A todolist app to keep track of all your tasks.

## the difference

- Latest provider package
- Using CheckboxListTile widget instead of ListTile with Checkbox trailing so user can check by clicking both the title or the box
- Swipe to delete instead of long pressed
